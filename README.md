# to run this project i am using uv instead of pip :

1. pip install uv 
2. uv sync 
3. uv run main.py

- main.py has functions to run ( VI PI MC and Qlearning ) and compare the algorithms 
- algorithms.py has all the classes for algorithms ( GPI MC QLearning)
- it would have been better to use arg parsers in main.py but i couldn't figure out how to do it
